Disclaimer : I had assistance from tutoring, AskBCS, and Google.

For this data analaysis challenge, I used six csv files to pull information about the employees from the time periods of 1980's to the 1990's. 
The first approach taken for these tables were to compare and skim through what the tables had in common. 
Next, I created an entity relation diagram to give a better visual of how the tables correlate to give me an idea of what the tables had in common and how I could join them.
Once we get to the data analysis, we pull up the employees and their salaries. This gives us an idea of how each individual is getting paid accordingly. 
The second data analysis shows us the amount of employees that were hired in the year 1986 alone. However, the data set was limited because we were not able to see the dates of employees who were fired or quit within any of the years. The advantage to this would be assessing and making predications on what and how the company can do to keep a stable employee count or adjust the work enviroment for the employees to increase their chances of staying with company.
Our third and fourth data analysis tells us the managers per department and a list of employees that worked in each department. This information allows us to learn who the managers were per department and who worked for them.
A table that gives us the Sales and Developments departments and their employees can tell us the total number of employees that worked for those departments. 
In conclusion, our dataset can help the company keep track of the employees in each department and their hiring rates. This helps identify staffing needs. We can also use this dataset to analyze employees hiring dates and determine the effectiveness of their hiring process. We can also see the department sizing based on the employees. The company can identify high performing departments and find areas for improvment. By analyzing the hire dates and employees in the departments, we can identify potential candidates for leadership roles based on their movements within the departments and their position from an employee to a department manager.
